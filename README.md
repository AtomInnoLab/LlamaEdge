# llama-utils

## Requirements

### For macOS (apple silicon)

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin(Metal enabled on apple silicon) via installer

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use zsh (the default shell on macOS), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.zshenv
```

### For Ubuntu (>= 20.04)

Because we enabled OpenBLAS on Ubuntu, you must install `libopenblas-dev` by `apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev`.

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin(OpenBLAS enabled) via installer

```bash
apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev # You may need sudo if the user is not root.
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use bash (the default shell on Ubuntu), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### For General Linux

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin via installer

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use bash (the default shell on Ubuntu), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

## Trouble shooting

- After running `apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev`, you may encountered the following error:

  ```bash
  ...
  E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
  E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
  ```

   This indicates that you are not logged in as `root`. Please try installing again using the `sudo` command:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev
  ```

- After running the `wasmedge` command, you may received the following error:

  ```bash
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error] loading failed: invalid path, Code: 0x20
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error]     load library failed:libblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  unknown option: nn-preload
  ```

  This suggests that your plugin installation was not successful. To resolve this issue, please attempt to install your desired plugin again.

## Command line options

- `LLAMA_LOG`: Set it to a non-empty value to enable logging.
- `LLAMA_N_CTX`: Set the context size, the same as the `--ctx-size` parameter in llama.cpp (default: 512).
- `LLAMA_N_PREDICT`: Set the number of tokens to predict, the same as the `--n-predict` parameter in llama.cpp (default: 512).

## Credits

The WASI-NN ggml plugin embedded [`llama.cpp`](git://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git@b1217) as its backend.
